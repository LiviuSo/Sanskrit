**Chapter 6**

**Feminine gender**

In addition to the masculine and neuter genders so far presented, Sanskrit has a feminine gender. Feminine substantives in -ā decline like the feminine of the adjective  **kāntā**. There are no masculine or neuter substantives that end in this -ā, and no feminine substantives in -a. The majority of adjectives (among them all past participles) that end in -a form their feminine in -ā. A substantial minority, however, form their feminine in -ī and inflect like ****nadī** ‘river’ (among this group are most adjectives formed by **vṛddhi** derivation). A certain number of adjectives have the option of either formation: so pāpa or **pāpī** (the latter is the more archaic form), feminine of **pāpa** ‘wicked’. Adjectives in -a with feminines in -ī are so indicated in the vocabulary, but the use of forms in -ī is not required in this chapter.

There is, of course, concord of adjectives, including pronominal adjectives, with feminine substantives:

**vayasya, iyaṁ sā vārttā** friend, this is that news

**Determinative compounds**

Present-day English shows a considerable fondness for forming determinatives. If the food we buy nowadays cannot be urged on us as either ‘home-baked’ or ‘farm-fresh’, it is at least quite likely to be ‘oven-ready’. A determinative compound is one in which the final element, whether adjective or substantive, is merely further defined by what precedes it:

1. **black:bird, girl:friend**

   new:found, ice:cold
2. **door-stop**

   man-eating
3. **sword-fight**

   hand-written
4. **dining-room**

   accident-prone
5. **book-learning**

   trouble-free
6. **status-symbol**

   class-conscious
7. **side-door**

   home-made

Each of the above examples is a limited exemplification of its final element. A blackbird is a bird, but of a particular kind; a dining-room is a room, but for a particular purpose. Similarly, the adjectives (including past participles) in the second column mean: cold to a particular degree, free from a particular thing, and so on.

If we compare determinative with other compounds, the point will become even clearer. Twenty: eight is not a particular kind of eight. Bare: foot is not a particular kind of foot (in fact, the compounded word is not even a substantive). Richard the Lion: heart was not a heart. And an overhead railway is not a ‘head railway’ of a special sort. (Our use of the underscore is explained on p. 100.)

In analysing in English the meaning of determinatives, we can usually make use of a preposition, chosen according to the sense of the compound. ‘Home-made’ no doubt means made in the home or at home (cf. home-baked); but ‘hand-made’ must mean made by hand or with one’s hands. In Sanskrit it is broadly possible to express the relationship between the elements of any particular determinative ( tatpuruṣa ) compound in terms of one of the seven cases. The above English examples are set out according to this analysis. Compounds analysed as involving nominative relationship will be discussed below. Those involving relationship in any oblique case (accusative to locative) are known as dependent determinatives.

**Dependent determinatives**

In the punctuation of compounds in this book, dependent determinative relationship is represented by a hyphen. Occasionally, when a more precise analysis is desired, a number from 2 to 7 is superscribed, representing the particular case. So

pākṣa-dvāram ‘side-door’, with locative (saptamī ‘seventh case’) relationship.

**Assignment to a particular oblique case may sometimes be arbitrary, and irrelevant to understanding of the compound. ‘Book-learning’ has been taken to be learning from books, but it might be thought of as learning in books (locative) or perhaps by means of books (instrumental). As an example of accusative case relationship, ‘door-stop’ may not be thought entirely convincing (it is here treated as ‘a stop (which stops) a door’, but perhaps it is simply ‘a stop for a door’ or ‘the stop of a door’). The point is, of course, that the accusative case essentially relates nouns to verbs. The corresponding relationship between substantives is expressed by the objective genitive. In a sense ****nṛpa-darśanam** ‘king-seeing’ contains an accusative relationship, but expressed by separate words it would appear as

**nṛpasya/nṛpayor/nṛpāṇāṁ darśanam** ‘sight of the king/kings’.

(A subjective genitive relationship may also be expressed by a determinative compound: in the appropriate context **nṛpa-darśanam** could also mean ‘sight by the king’ etc.)

The last example will serve to remind you of the principle that stem forms are indeterminate between singular, dual and plural. There is a similar indeterminacy in English, as the example ‘book-learning’ will have suggested. In the same way a ‘garage-owner’ may own one or many garages. A phrase such as ‘child welfare’ (the welfare of children) shows that determinative relationship in English may exist between words not joined by a hyphen.

Although such compounds are frequent in English, they are by no means substitutable in all circumstances for more analytical turns of phrase. In general they denote characteristic rather than ad hoc relationships. A ‘hand-held’ camera is such by virtue of its design or at least some deliberate policy of its user. We do not say ‘He brandished the hand-held book’ instead of ‘He brandished the book held in his hand’. In Classical Sanskrit there is no such inhibition. Wherever nouns are connected among themselves by oblique case relationships, compounds are formed extensively. In fact, a long sentence composed entirely of short words each with its own case termination would have seemed unnecessarily clumsy.

**saṁvadaty ubhayor Mālatī-niveditaḥ śarīr-ākāraḥ**

[the appearance-of-body reported-by-Mālatī fits for both] they are both as Mālatī described them.

**kala-jñā (2) devī — kāry>-oparodham (6) me pariharati**

Her Majesty is ['occasion-knowing'] tactful — she avoids interruption-of-my-business.

**The compound ****kala-jñā** illustrates the fact that a number of forms are found at the end of determinative compounds which would never be used as words by themselves. In particular, many verbal roots are so used, predominantly with an active participial sense. If the root ends in a consonant, it is inflected according to the consonant declension (to be described later). Furthermore, roots ending in  **i** **, ****u** or **ṛ** add a euphonic  **t** **. But roots in ****ā** and certain others are simplified so as to end in  **a** **, and are inflected like ****kānta** (thus  **kala-jñā** **, from ****jñā** 'know').

| **dṛś** | **see**     | **sarva-dṛś (2)** | **all-seeing**                   |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **kṛ**   | **make**    | **vighna-kṛt (2)** | **obstacle-making, interfering** |
| **jī**   | **conquer** | **satya-jit (3)**   | **conquering by truth**          |
| **sthā** | **stand**   | **mārga-stha (7)** | **standing (being) in the road** |
| **jan**   | **be born** | **jala-ja (7)**     | **born in the water**            |

**Very frequent also in such compounds is the root extended by the suffix ** **a** **. So side by side exist ****jala-ruh** (consonant-stem) and **jala-ruha** (inflected like  **kānta** **) 'growing in the water'.**

**Occasionally compounds are found in which the first member appears in an inflected instead of a stem form, and this is not uncommon when the final member cannot be used as an independent word. So ****agre-ga** 'going in front' from **agra** 'front' and the root  **gam** **. From the same root ****hṛdayamgama** 'going to the heart'. An example of a case termination (here dative singular) before a word which also occurs independently is the grammatical term **parasmai-padam** 'word for another, active voice'. In such instances, one of the most important criteria for the existence of a compound rather than two separate words is lacking, but others remain: in Vedic, specialised meaning or unity of accent; in Classical Sanskrit, specialised meaning or the ability to occur as part of a longer compound.

**The word ****arthaḥ** 'purpose' is used adverbially at the end of compounds, usually in the accusative case,  **artham** **, to mean 'for the sake of':**

* **udak>-artham** 'for the sake of water', 'for water', 'to get water';
* **kim-artham** 'for the sake of what', 'for what purpose', 'why?'.
* 

The first member of a dependent determinative must be a nominal or pronominal substantive, or a substantively used adjective (e.g., priya m. and priyā f. 'loved one'—or the first of these two forms, priya, used with neuter significance, 'benefit, service'). This does not apply to the other class of determinative compounds.

**Descriptive determinatives**

For this type of determinative there is a special name in Sanskrit, karmadhāraya. The notion that it expresses a nominative relationship between the two members should not be pressed too far, for where the final member is an adjective it is not usually possible to achieve even an approximate representation of the sense of the compound merely by assigning the same case ending to the first member as to the second. The point is rather that in descriptives the first element stands in an attributive relationship (represented in the punctuation by a colon) to the second. Where the second element is a noun, the relationship is adjectival, the first element being either an adjective or a substantive used 'adjectivally', that is to say in apposition. Where the second element is an adjective, the relationship is adverbial, and the first element is either an adverbially used adjective (or sometimes an actual adverb) or an adverbially used substantive. Karmadhārayas may thus conveniently be discussed under four main headings.

1. **Adjective + substantive** (black:bird). What is true of such compounds in English originally applied in Sanskrit too. They were used principally where the compound had a conventional significance transcending the separate meanings of its parts. In the same way that 'blackbird' in English does not mean just any bird that is black, so the equivalent Sanskrit compound kṛṣṇa-śakuni meant, in fact, a crow. Even in the Classical period it remains true that an adjective qualifying a substantive preserves its own inflexion in the vast majority of cases, in preference to being compounded in its stem form with the latter. However, there was a continuous whittling away at this principle. It was often violated in verse for reasons of metrical convenience. Common adjectives of unemphatic meaning such as mahā 'great' and sva ('my, etc.') may be used fairly freely, and so may common collocations such as priya-vayasyaḥ 'dear friend'. In later Sanskrit prose words like sarva 'all' and anya 'other' are compounded in karmadhārayas with increasing frequency. In the exercises you should not yourself form karmadhārayas of adjective plus substantive unless directed to do so. (But this does not apply to karmadhārayas forming part of a longer compound: see Chapter 7.)

An adjective has only one stem form for all three genders, deriving from that of the masculine–neuter. So priya-sakhī 'dear [female] friend', not priya-sakhī, which could only be either two separate words or a dependent compound meaning 'friend of (my) sweetheart'.

2. **Substantive + substantive** (girl:friend)**.** In these compounds the substantives are in appositional relationship: so rāja-ṛṣi 'king-seer'. In particular, titles are compounded:

amātya: Bhūrirvasu 'Minister Bhūrirvasu'; bhaṭṭa: Ōdbhaṭaḥ 'Dr Udbhaṭa'. Other types are strījanaḥ 'womenfolk', dhvaniḥ śabdaḥ 'the word "dhvani"'. Where proper names are involved, the expected order is sometimes reversed: thus Rāma-bhadraḥ 'dear Rāma', Sītā-devī 'Queen Sītā'.

One particular type of karmadhāraya made from two substantives is of great importance in literary style. It may be called the karmadhāraya of comparison. According to Sanskrit literary critics, it embodies the figure of speech called rūpakaṃ 'metaphor' (as opposed to upamā 'simile'), in which one makes a comparison by stating directly that something is something else. So if we take the word padmaṃ 'lotus' and qualify it by the word pādaḥ 'foot', we have the compound pāda-padmaṃ 'foot lotus, a lotus consisting of a foot'. This means, in effect, 'a lotus-like foot', and such compounds are often so translated, though strictly speaking such translations would exemplify upamā and not rūpakaṃ. The more literal way to translate these compounds is by means of the preposition 'of', also useful in translating other types of appositional karmadhāraya, e.g.,

**Kāñcī-puraṃ** 'the city of Kāñcī': so 'the lotus of (your) foot'; smitā-jyotsnā 'the moonlight of (her) smile'; nara-puṃgavaḥ 'a bull of a man', etc.:

**katham, idānīm unmādô-parāga eva Mādhavêndum āskandati**

what, does the eclipse of insanity now attack the moon of Mādhava? (i.e. does insanity engulf him, like an eclipse engulfing the moon?)

3. **Adjective/adverb + adjective** (new:found)**.** So from udagra 'intense' and ramaṇīya 'lovely', udagra-ramaṇīya 'intensely lovely'. A past participle as a final member is particularly common: nava-baddha 'new-bound, newly bound'; madhurôkta 'spoken sweetly'.

The first member may be an actual adverb: punar-ukta 'spoken again, repeated'; anyathā-vādin 'speaking otherwise'; bahih-śruta 'heard outside'; atra-stha 'standing here'.

Certain past participles may be qualified adverbially by words which in a verbal sentence would stand in a predicative relationship. So corresponding to the sentence sa śrānta āgacchati 'he arrives tired' is the compound śrāntāgata 'arriving tired'. In particular, substantives, adjectives or adverbs which would appear as the complement of the verb bhū 'be' may qualify its past participle bhūta 'having become, being': so nimittabhūta 'being the cause', sukumāra·bhūta 'being delicate', evambhūta 'being so'; bhūta need not always be translated into English, serving merely to smooth or clarify the construction in Sanskrit, e.g.:

**mad-anūja-maraṇa-nimitta·bhūtāyāḥ pāpāyāḥ Bālacandrikāyāḥ**

'of the wicked Bālacandrikā, cause of my brother's death...'

(Occasionally an instance occurs of an adverb predicatively qualifying a substantive: alam anyathāsaṃbhāvanayā 'enough of supposing otherwise'.)

    4.**substantive + adjective** (ice:cold). A substantive adverbially qualifying an adjective typically implies a comparison: hima·śiśira 'ice-cold, cold as ice'; prāṇa·priya 'dear as life'.

As karmadhāraya compounds, these compounds have such a meaning. Ambiguity arises, however, because they may often be interpreted as dependent determinatives with, for instance, instrumental or ablative relationship: so hima-śiśira might mean 'cold because of the ice'. The same author may write in one place priyaṅgu·śyāma 'dark as the black vine', and in another kādambinī·śyāmala '(skies) dark with rainclouds'.

**Prepositions**

The relationships expressed by the Sanskrit case terminations are expressed in English by a number of prepositions: 'to', 'with', 'for', 'from', 'in', etc. The existence of six oblique cases, each used in a variety of circumstances, means that the use of prepositions is a comparatively unimportant feature of Sanskrit. In the Vedic language (as in other Indo-European languages) the particles used as verbal prefixes are also found functioning as prepositions, usually placed after the noun they govern. But in Classical Sanskrit only two of these remain really important, ā and prati. ā governs the ablative and usually means 'up to': ā ****samudrāt** 'up to the ocean'. It is the only preposition regularly placed before its noun (the others would more appropriately be called postpositions). prati means firstly 'towards, against' and, by extension, 'with regard to': vanaṃ prati 'towards the forest', **devasyāsvāsthyaṃ prati** 'with respect to Your Majesty's illness'.

anu (with accusative) 'after' also occurs. Related to the verbal prefix sam is the preposition saha referred to in Chapter 4.

In addition, there are a number of prepositions of adverbial and nominal origin, for instance vinā (usually with instrumental) 'without', paścāt (with ablative or genitive) 'behind'. These shade into the use, with the genitive, of a number of nouns of somewhat blunted meaning, e.g. madhye 'in the middle of, among': eka eva mama putrāṇāṃ madhye 'one alone among my sons'. Instead of the genitive, a determinative compound may be formed:

**tan-madhyāt kim idam ekam? 'is this one [from among:] of them?'**

jala-mārgena paśyāmaḥ 'let us watch [by way of:] through the window'.

**Occasionally such compounding occurs even with actual prepositions: e.g. rathôpari instead of rathasya ôpari 'upon the chariot'.**

**Verbal action nouns in a**

It is well worth noticing the more important types of nominal stem formation from the Sanskrit root, not in order to form such stems for oneself but in order to make sense of the relationship between various individual items of vocabulary. One of the most important is the addition of a to the root to form a masculine substantive. Normally the root appears in guṇa grade, and the predominant meaning is of an abstract 'action' noun: so from the root krudh 'be angry', krodhaḥ 'anger'. Similarly, but with some development of meaning, from diś 'point', deśaḥ 'point, place, country'.

The verbal root and the derived noun may have a prefix: sam + dih 'smear, confuse', samdehaḥ 'confusion, doubt'; upa + i 'approach', upāyaḥ 'approach, means'.

Vṛddhi instead of guṇa is quite often found, but only where the resulting vowel is ā: **vi** + **sad** 'be dejected', **viṣādaḥ** 'dejection'; **bhṛ** 'bear', **bhāraḥ** 'burden'. The longer grade is particularly found after a prefix: thus from ru 'roar', **ravaḥ** 'roar' but **samrāvaḥ** 'uproar'.

A point to be noted particularly is that (for historical reasons) roots ending in a palatal stop usually change that stop to the corresponding velar: vij 'start; tremble', āvegaḥ/samvegaḥ 'agitation'; śuc 'grieve', śokaḥ 'grief'.

Among examples of the formation in the vocabulary of Exercise 6 are:

**anu + śī** — lie alongside, **anuśayaḥ** — consequence, regret

**abhi + laṣ** — crave, **abhilāṣaḥ** — craving

**ā + rabh** — begin, **ārambhaḥ** — beginning

**pari + has** — laugh, **parihāsaḥ** — laughter

**prati + sidh** — forbid, **pratiṣedhaḥ** — prohibition

**pra + viś** — enter, **praveśaḥ** — entry

**vi + ava + hṛ** — deal with, **vyavahāraḥ** — dealings, usage

**Ambiguities of external sandhi**

Sometimes the operation of different sandhi rules can lead to a single result, so that the final form is ambiguous. The following are the ambiguities most likely to cause difficulty:

1. **nn** may represent **t + n** or  **n + n** **.**

   **Example:** asmānna **←** asmāt + na or asmān + na

   Furthermore, if the vowel preceding the **nn** is short, this may represent the sandhi of final **n** before a vowel.

   **Example:** paśyannāste **←** paśyan + āste, paśyan + nāste or paśyat + nāste
2. **a** before a vowel other than **a** may represent **aḥ** or  **e** **.**

   **Example:** aśva eva **←** aśvaḥ + eva or aśve eva

   (Theoretically the ****a**** might also represent a final * ***o*** *, but this is rare.)*
3. **ā** before a voiced consonant may represent **āḥ** or simple  **ā** **.**

   **Example:** kanyā nayati **←** kanyāḥ nayati or kanyā nayati
4. **cch** may represent **t + ś** or  **t + ch** **.**

   **Example:** asmācchalāt **←** asmāt + śalāt or asmāt + chalāt
5. **ggh** etc. may represent a stop followed by **h** or by **gh** etc.

   **Example:** asmāddhṛtāt **←** asmāt + hṛtāt or asmāt + dhṛtāt
6. Long vowel followed by ****r** may represent long/short vowel with **ḥ** or itself alone.

*Example:* śuci rakṣati **←** śuciḥ rakṣati, śuciḥ + rakṣati, śuci + rakṣati

The sandhi of two vowels is also a source of ambiguity, but here a learner is less likely to assume one particular resolution of the sandhi. The possibilities implicit in the sandhi vowels ā, ī, ū, e, ai, o, au are set out in Table 2.2.
