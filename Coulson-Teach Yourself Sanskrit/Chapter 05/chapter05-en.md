**Chapter 5**  
  
Paradigms: m. and n. of kānta, aham, tvam, saḥ, eṣaḥ and ayam; present
indicative of as 'be'  
Sanskrit grammarians discussed the cases of the noun in terms of
inflexional morphemes modifying the nominal stem. In addition to the
vocative (saṃbuddhi, not regarded as on a par with the other cases),
those so far introduced have been the nominative (prathamā 'first
(inflexion)'), the accusative (dvitīyā 'second') and the instrumental
(tṛtīyā 'third'). The order of the cases in Sanskrit was principally
determined by the wish to group like endings together. The following is
a brief sketch (by no means a full account) of the chief uses of the
remaining cases.  
**Dative (caturthī 'fourth'): 'to, for'**  
Of all the cases the dative has the smallest scope. In Middle Indo-Aryan
dialects it was lost, merged into the genitive. Even in Sanskrit itself
the tendency of the genitive to usurp the traditional functions of the
dative is very noticeable. The dative may be used to denote the indirect
object after verbs of giving, telling, etc.:  
**दत्तं मया ब्राह्मणेभ्यः द्रविणम्।** **dattam mayā brāhmaṇebhyaḥ
draviṇam** *I have given the brahmins wealth.*  
But in such a sentence the genitive **brāhmaṇānām** may be substituted
for the dative.  
However, the dative in Classical Sanskrit does have one function not
shared by any other case, that of denoting purpose or result. The best
translation in English is often by means of an infinitive:  
**लण्ड्रं गच्छामि नृपस्य दर्शनाय।** **Laṇḍraṃ gacchāmi nṛpasya
darśanāya** *I'm going to London \[for the seeing of:\] to see the
king.*  
**अङ्गनां भङ्गायारूढाः बालाः प्राकारः।** **aṅganāṁ bhaṅgāya ārūḍhāḥ
bālāḥ prākāraḥ** *the children climbed the wall \[for the breaking of:\]
only to break their limbs.*  
Especially noteworthy is the use of such a dative as a predicate in
itself:  
**सर्वमातिमात्रं दोषाय।** **sarvam atimātram doṣāya** *all (that is)
excessive \[is for a fault:\] becomes reprehensible.*  
**Ablative (pañcamī 'fifth'): 'from'**  
The ablative expresses the relationship 'from':  
**नगरात् क्षेत्राणि गच्छति।** **nagarāt kṣetrāṇi gacchati** *he goes
from the city to the fields.*  
When a causal relationship is implied, translations such as 'because of'
may be used: **क्रोधात् krodhāt** 'from anger', 'out of anger', 'because
of anger', 'through anger'.  
The ablative of comparison will be mentioned later.  
  
**Genitive (ṣaṣṭhī 'sixth'): 'of, 's/s'**  
The genitive is the case with the widest range of uses. It most often
qualifies another substantive and has a possessive sense of some kind:  
**नृपस्य क्रोधं नावगच्छामः।** **nṛpasya krodhaṁ na avagacchāmaḥ** *we do
not understand the king's anger/the anger of the king.*  
Where the substantive embodies a verbal notion, the relationship may be
either subjective or objective, just as the word 'its' in English is
subjective in the phrase 'its consumption of electricity' and objective
in 'its consumption by the community'. **nṛpasya** in the preceding
example is subjective (the king is angry); in **नृपस्य दर्शनं nṛpasya
darśanam**, when this means 'sight of the king', it is objective (I see
the king).  
The use of the genitive as an alternative to the dative after verbs of
giving, telling, etc., has been mentioned. Furthermore, it is the
genitive and **not** the dative that should be used in relation to
adjectives to express 'point of view', conveyed in English by 'to' or
'for':  
**मित्राणामेव प्रियं एतत् दर्शनम्।** **mitrāṇām eva priyaṁ etat
darśanam** *to friends, this is a welcome sight.*  
**तत्स्थाने अस्य वृश्चलः देवः।** **tat sthāne asya Vṛṣalaḥ
devaḥ** *Chandraguptaḥ then appropriately is His Majesty Chandragupta
(just) 'Vṛṣala' to him.*  
**श्रुतम् --- न पुनः पर्याप्तं हृदयस्य।** **śrutam --- na punaḥ
paryāptaṁ hṛdayasya** *(I) have heard, yet (it is) not sufficient for
(my) heart.*  
Similarly, past participles formed from roots meaning 'to know', 'to
desire' or 'to honour', such as **विदित vidita** 'known', take a
genitive (instead of an instrumental of the agent) when used
adjectivally:  
**अपि विदितं एतत् देवस्य।** **api viditam etat devasya** *is this known
to Your Majesty?*  
But:  
**अपि विदितं देवेना तेषां अभिप्रायः।** **api viditam devena teṣāṁ
abhiprāyaḥ** *did Your Majesty (get to) know their intentions?*  
The possessive adjective **मदीय madīya** 'my, mine' was given in the
previous chapter. There are various others---e.g. **मामक māmaka** (same
meaning), **युष्मदीय yuṣmadīya** 'belonging to (all of) you', etc. More
commonly, however, the genitive of the appropriate pronoun is used
instead of the possessive adjective:  
**मम गृहम्** **mama gṛham** *\[the house of me:\] my house.*  
**मम क्षेत्राणि** **mama kṣetrāṇi** *my fields.*  
**तव पुत्राः** **tava putrāḥ** *your sons* (addressing one person).  
**युष्माकं पुत्राः** **yuṣmākaṁ putrāḥ** *your sons* (addressing several
persons).  
**कस्य पुष्पाणि** **kasya puṣpāṇi** *whose flowers?*  
**तस्य हस्तौ** **tasya hastau** *his hands.*  
The unemphatic forms of the first and second person pronouns (**मे me,
नौ nau**, etc.) may also be used. Like the ordinary forms, they may
either precede or follow their substantive, but as enclitics they may
not stand first in the sentence:  
**इमे नो गृहाः।** **ime no gṛhāḥ** *here is our house* (the plural of
**gṛha** often has a singular sense).  
Generally speaking, neither possessive adjectives nor the genitives of
pronouns may be used to refer to the subject or 'logical subject' of a
sentence. If necessary, the reflexive adjective **स्व sva** 'my own,
your own, his own, their own, etc.' or the genitive singular of the
reflexive word आत्मन् ātman \'self\' may be employed, but it is usually
omitted unless exceptional emphasis is intended. \[sva is often
compounded with its substantive, while as a separate word ātmanaḥ is
more normal.\]  
पुत्रान्रक्षति putrān rakṣati he protects his sons  
तस्य पुत्रान्रक्षति tasya putrān rakṣati he protects his \[i.e. the
other\'s\] sons  
स्वान् एव पुत्रान् रक्षसि svān eva putrān rakṣasi you protect your own sons  
Because the omission of the reflexive possessive is standard, it is from
now on not normally indicated in the exercises by any bracketing of the
English word: \'he protects his sons\', not \'he protects (his)
sons\'.  
  
**Locative** (saptamī \'seventh\'): \'at, in, on, among; into, onto\'  
The locative expresses such notions as station or circumstance:  
चरति वने किम् चित् carati vane kiṃ cit something is moving in the forest  
फलकॆ बालाः उपविष्टाः phalake bālāḥ upaviṣṭāḥ the children are seated on
the table  
मित्राणां दर्शनॆ न किम् चित् वदति mitrānām darśane na kiṃ cit vadati \[at the
sight of:\] on seeing his friends he says nothing  
It also expresses the end result of motion:  
जले बालम् क्षिपति jale bālaṃ kṣipati he throws the child into the water  
It can bear the sense \'in the matter of\':  
अपापो ऽहं पर्वतेश्वरॆ apāpaḥ ahaṃ Parvateśvare \[in the matter of:\] I am
guiltless towards Parvateśvara  
In particular, it is used to denote the object of feelings (English
\'towards\', \'for\'):  
अवगच्छामि ते तस्मिन्सौहार्दम् avagacchāmi te tasmin sauhārdam I understand
your fondness for him  
It thus occurs after a verb such as स्निह् snih \'feel affection
(for)\':  
किम् नु खलु बालॆ अस्मिन् औत्सॆ इव पुत्रे स्निह्यति मॆ हृदयम्? kiṃ nu khalu bāle asmin
autrase iva putre snihyati me hṛdayaṃ? now does not my heart feel
affection for the boy as if for my own son?  
**why indeed does my heart feel affection for this child as for a son of
my own loins?**  
The use of the locative in expressing circumstance leads to the
\'locative absolute\' construction (Chapter 11).  
  
**Expressions of time**  
Many of the cases are used in expressing statements of time. The
following is an indication of the main usages:  
(a) **Accusative, \'time during which\':** **त्रीन् दिवसान् भ्रमन्ति
trīn divasān bhramanti** *they wander for three days*  
(b) **Instrumental, \'time within which\':** **ते अपि त्रिभिः दिवसैः
नगरं प्राप्ताः te api tribhiḥ divasaiḥ nagaram prāptāḥ** *and they
reached the city in three days*  
(c) **Ablative (sometimes genitive), \'time after which\':** **ते अपि
त्रिभ्यः दिवसेभ्यः प्राप्ताः te api tribhyaḥ divasebhyaḥ prāptāḥ** *and
they arrived after three days*  
**चिरस्य कालस्य प्राप्तोऽसि cirasya kālasya prāpto \'si** *you have
arrived after a long time/at long last*  
(d) **Locative, \'time at which\':** **ते अपि तृतीये दिवसे नगरं
प्राप्ताः te api tṛtīye divase nagaram prāptāḥ** *and they reached the
city on the third day*  
  
**ayam**  
The irregularity of the declension of the pronoun **ayam** is partly due
to the fact that it derives from two stems: one **a** (cf. the adverbs
**atra** and **ataḥ: ataḥ**), the other **i** (cf. **iha** and **itaḥ:
itaḥ**).  
Two pronouns are conventionally translated by the English *\'that\'*:
**सः saḥ** and **असौ asau** (Chapter 13); and two by the English
*\'this\':* **अयम् ayam** and **एषः eṣaḥ**. Traditionally, the
distinctions are that **saḥ** is used of what is not present to the
speaker, **asau** of what is remote from him (though possibly visible),
**ayam** of what is present, and **eṣaḥ** of what is near at hand.  
Thus **asau** is the \'stronger\' of the two which mean *\'that\'*,
**eṣaḥ** the \'stronger\' of the two which mean *\'this\'*.  
It is evident that even if these distinctions were adhered to there
would be considerable overlap within each pair (and also that **ayam**
in particular might represent *\'that\'* as well as *\'this\'*). In
practice, the distinctions are somewhat blurred and, at any rate, not
always easy to apply. A different distinction is that, used in reference
to discourse, **eṣaḥ** means *\'what precedes\'*, **ayam** *\'what
follows\'*.  
**श्रुत्वा एतदिदं वदति śrutvā etat idam vadati** *hearing this, he says
the following*  
This rule also is not universally observed, but it is true enough to be
worth remembering.  
In the oblique cases other than the accusative (and in practice to some
extent in all cases), **ayam** may be used simply as an unemphatic third
person pronoun. In this sense it is usually enclitic.  
**क्रोधम् एषां न अवगच्छामि krodham eṣāṃ na avagacchāmi** *I don't
understand their anger*  
  
**Pronominal adjectives**  
Certain common adjectives in **a** follow wholly or in part the
pronominal rather than the nominal declension. **anya** *\'other\'* does
so wholly: its neuter singular nominative/accusative is **अन्यत् anyat**
(cf. the *d* of Latin *aliud*). **सर्व sarva** *\'all\'*, **एक eka**
*\'one\'* and **स्व sva** *\'own\'* are also wholly pronominal, except
that their neuter singular nominative/accusative is **सर्वम् sarvam**,
**एकम् ekam**, **स्वम् svam**.  
**सर्वेषां नृपाणाम् अयं मार्गः sarveṣāṃ nṛpāṇāṃ ayaṃ
mārgaḥ** *this is the path for all kings*  
**एकस्मिन्नेव देशे सर्वे बालाः ekasmin eva deśe sarve bālāḥ** *the
children are all in a single place*  
In conjunction with an interrogative, **अन्य anya** may be translated by
*\'else\':*  
**अन्यः कः आगच्छति anyaḥ kaḥ āgacchati?** *who else is coming?*  
  
**kaś cit and ko 'pi**  
The addition of an indefinite particle, usually either **चित् cit** or
**अपि api**, turns the interrogative pronoun (*\'who?\'*, *\'what?\'*)
into an indefinite pronoun (*\'someone\'*, *\'anyone\'*, *\'some\'*,
*\'any\'*, *\'a little'*, 'a few'). The addition of **न na** ('not
anyone' etc.) gives the Sanskrit for 'no one', 'nothing', etc.  
**केन जलं पीतम् kena jalam pītam?** *who has drunk the water?*  
**केनापि जलं पीतम्/केन चित् जलं पीतम् kena api jalam pītam/kena cit
jalam pītam** *someone/somebody has drunk the water*  
**केनापि जलं न पीतम् kena api jalam na pītam** *no one/nobody has drunk
the water*  
**उद्यान ेन कः चित् चरति udyāne na kaḥ cit carati** *no one is walking
in the park*  
**तव किम् चित् जलं भवति?---न किम् चित् एव tava kim cit jalam
bhavati?---na kim cit eva** *have you any/a little water?---none at
all*  
Interrogative adverbs are used in the same way:  
**कलहंसकं न क्व चित् पश्यामि Kalahaṃsakaṃ na kva cit paśyāmi** *I
don't see Kalahamsaka anywhere*  
**कृतः कथम् अपि घटः kṛtaḥ katham api ghataḥ** *somehow (he) made the
pot*  
**कथम् अपि katham api** or **कथं चित् katham cit** has by extension the
sense 'scarcely', 'with difficulty':  
**चन्द्रं कथम् अपि पश्यामि candram katham api paśyāmi** *I can only just
see the moon*  
  
**as 'be'**  
The verb as 'be', a very common irregular verb, is an athematic of class
II (Chapter 12). The six first and second person forms of the present
indicative provide an alternative to (and are, in fact, much more
frequent than) the use of pronominal subjects in nominal and past
participial sentences. So:  
**अतिकातरः असि atikātaraḥ asi** as well as **अतिकातरः त्वम् atikātaraḥ
tvam** *'you are over-timid';* and  
**गतः अस्मि gataḥ asmi** as well as **गतः अहम् gataḥ aham** *'I
went'.*  
Similarly **धन्यौ स्वः dhanyau svaḥ** *'the two of us are
lucky'*, **प्राप्तौ स्थः prāptau sthaḥ** *'the two of you have
arrived'*, etc.  
These forms are normally enclitic.  
The third person forms (**अस्ति asti**, **स्तः staḥ**, **सन्ति
santi**), on the other hand, are seldom if ever used as a copula but
have existential force (*'there is', 'there are'*) and most frequently
stand as the first word.  
**अस्ति पर्वतेषु नगरम् asti parvateṣu nagaram** *there is in the
mountains a city*  
**अतः परम् अपि प्रियं अस्ति ataḥ param api priyam asti?** *is there
(any) blessing beyond this?*  
**अस्ति एतत् asti etat** *this is --- i.e. this is true, that is so*  
  
**bhū 'be'**  
This verb, a regular verb of class I, may mean in its non-copulative
uses either 'exist' (like **as**) or 'come into existence', 'arise':  
**भवन्ति च अत्र श्लोकाः bhavanti ca atra ślokāḥ** *and on this point
there are stanzas*  
**क्रोधात् भवति सम्मोहः krodhāt bhavati sammohaḥ** *from anger arises
delusion*  
As a copulative verb it provides a less frequent alternative to a
nominal sentence, more particularly in general statements.  
**दर्शनम् एव अस्य रमणीयं भवति परिशान्तानां darśanam eva asya ramanīyaṃ
bhavati pariśāntānāṃ** *the very sight of it is delightful to the
exhausted*  
  
**'To have'**  
The notion of the English 'have' in the sense of 'possess' is generally
expressed by means of the genitive case: i.e. instead of *'John has a
hat',* one says *'of John there is a hat'.* However, even in this
existential sense the verb **as** or **bhū** is sometimes omitted.  
**तव पुत्राणां धनं न भवति tava putrāṇāṃ dhanaṃ na bhavati** *your
sons have no money*  
**अस्ति च अस्माकं अन्यत् अपि मित्रम् asti ca asmākam anyat api
mitram** *and we have another friend too*  
**श्रुतम् असंतोषः तु हृदयस्य śrutam -- asantoṣaḥ tu hṛdayasya** *(I)
have heard, but \[(there is) dissatisfaction for my heart:\]* *my heart
has/feels no satisfaction (Compare the use of var­tate \[Chapter 9\].)*  
  
**'To feel'**  
As the above example suggests, there are various ways in which the
notion *'to feel (an emotion etc.)'* might be represented in Sanskrit.
It may, however, be worth pointing out that the equivalent of **इव iva**
in first person statements is often 'feel' ('seem' being
inappropriate):  
**अशरणः इव अस्मि aśaraṇaḥ iva asmi** *I feel helpless*  
**The absolutive**  
Of an ancient verbal action noun in **-tu** (cf. the Latin supine) two
cases survive in Classical Sanskrit: the accusative, supplying the
Sanskrit infinitive (**नेतुम् netum 'to lead',** with strengthening of
the root), and the instrumental, supplying the absolutive (or 'gerund',
or 'indeclinable participle')---**नीत्वा nītvā 'after leading, by
leading',** with weak grade of the root.  
The absolutive in **-tvā** is not difficult to form. With very few
exceptions it may be obtained by substituting **tvā** for the **-ta** or
**-na** of the past participle (with internal sandhi as appropriate). So
**उक्त्वा uktvā 'after saying', दृष्ट्वा dṛṣtvā 'after seeing',
लब्ध्वा labdhvā 'after taking', पतित्वा patitvā 'after falling',
तीर्त्वा tīrtvā 'after crossing'.**  
The absolutive in **-tvā** may **not** be used when a verb is compounded
with a prefix or prefixes. In such a case the suffix **-ya** (probably
itself the instrumental of an old action noun in **-i**) is added to the
verb, which usually appears in its weaker form. In internal sandhi,
fortunately, **y** is without effect on the preceding sound. Roots
ending in a short vowel add **-tya** instead of **-ya**, and those roots
ending in **-an/-am** which shorten to **-a** in the past participle may
**optionally** do so (again shortening to **-a**). So **संदृश्य
samdṛśya 'after seeing', प्रत्युत्य pratyutya 'after replying', विजित्य
vijitya 'after conquering', आगम्य āgamya** or **आगत्य āgatya 'after
coming'.**  
(A minor exception to both the above formations is provided by
derivative verbs in **-ayati.** They form their past participle in
**-ita** but their simple absolutive in **-ayitvā.** In the compounded
absolutive, they substitute **-ya** for **-ayati** in general but
**-ayya** if the vowel of the stem is unstrengthened. So **गमयित्वा
gamayitvā 'after causing to go', आगमय्य āgamayya 'after causing to
come', प्रवेश्य praveśya 'after causing to enter'.** See pp. 85--7.)  
The sense of the absolutive is generally that of action preceding the
action of the main verb. Its closest equivalent is often therefore in
primer English the perfect participle (*'having led'*) and in ordinary
English the present participle (*'leading'*).  
**गृहं त्यक्त्वा वने परिभ्रमति gṛham tyaktvā vane
paribhramati** *leaving his home, he wanders about in the forest*  
This might alternatively be translated as *'he leaves his home and
wanders\...'*. In English both versions are possible.  
  
  
**...**  
  
  
  
'Assuredly', 'of course', 'after all', 'certainly'. दारुणः खल्वसि। dāruṇaḥ
khalu asi you are indeed cruel  
कापालिकः खल्वेषः। kāpālikaḥ khalu eṣaḥ this man is assuredly a monster  
अनुत्सेकः खलु विक्रमालङ्कारः। anutsekaḥ khalu vikramālaṅkāraḥ modesty, after
all, is valour's ornament  
  
External Sandhi Now that a wider range of forms is occurring in the
exercises, attention is drawn to two disconcerting rules of external
sandhi: (a) final n preceded by a short vowel is doubled when the next
word begins with a vowel (thus when n closes a word, the final syllable
can never be light) and (b) t combines with a following ś to make cch.
