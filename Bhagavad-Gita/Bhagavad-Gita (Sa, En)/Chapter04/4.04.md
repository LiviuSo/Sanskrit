### **Final English Translation with Grammar in Mind:**

*"Arjuna said: Your birth is recent, whereas the birth of Vivasvān (the Sun-god) is ancient. How then am I to understand that you spoke this (yoga) in the beginning?"*

---

### **Explanation of Word Relationships:**

1. **Arjuna uvāca** – This phrase introduces Arjuna as the speaker.
2. **aparam bhavato janma** – "Your birth is later/recent" (contrasting with Vivasvān's birth).
3. **param janma vivasvataḥ** – "Vivasvān’s birth is earlier/ancient" (indicating the paradox).
4. **katham etad vijānīyām** – "How may I understand this?" (Arjuna's doubt).
5. **tvam ādau proktavān iti** – "That you spoke (this knowledge) in the beginning" (what Arjuna finds puzzling).

This verse expresses Arjuna’s skepticism about Krishna's claim that He instructed the Sun-god Vivasvān in ancient times, even though Krishna appears to have been born much later.
