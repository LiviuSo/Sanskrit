### **Full English Translation**

**"Your ( *bhavataḥ* ) birth ( *janma* ) is recent ( *aparam* ), the birth ( *janma* ) of Vivasvat ( *vivasvataḥ* ) is ancient ( *param* ). How ( *katham* ) should I understand ( *vijānīyām* ) this ( *etat* ), that you ( *tvam* ) spoke ( *proktavān* ) to him at the beginning ( *ādau* )?"**

This is Arjuna expressing doubt about how Kṛṣṇa could have instructed the sun-god Vivasvat long ago, given His (Kṛṣṇa’s) seemingly recent birth.
