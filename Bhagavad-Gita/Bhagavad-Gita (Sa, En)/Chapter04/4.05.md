*"The Blessed Lord said: Many births of mine and of yours have passed, O Arjuna. I know all of them, but you do not, O scorcher of enemies."*

### **Explanation of Word Relationships:**

1. **śrī-bhagavān uvāca** – "The Blessed Lord said" (introducing Krishna as the speaker).
2. **bahūni me vyatītāni janmāni tava ca** – "Many births of mine and of yours have passed" (Krishna and Arjuna have had multiple past lives).
3. **tāni ahaṁ veda sarvāṇi** – "I know all those (births)" (Krishna has full knowledge of past lives).
4. **na tvaṁ vettha parantapa** – "But you do not know them, O scorcher of enemies" (Arjuna lacks this divine memory).

This verse highlights Krishna’s omniscience and contrasts it with Arjuna’s limited human knowledge.
