### **Final English Translation with Grammar in Mind:**

*"That very same ancient yoga has today been spoken by me to you, because you are my devotee and my friend. Indeed, this is the supreme secret."*

This analysis shows how the words relate grammatically and how Krishna emphasizes that the knowledge He imparts is both ancient and a supreme secret, given only to a devotee and friend like Arjuna.
