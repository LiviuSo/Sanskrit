#### of Krșņa-Dvaipāyana Vyāsa
#### originally translated in English by Kisari Mohan Ganguli

The original text was formatted then organized into a folder hierarchy following the structure of Mahabharata: books, sub-books and sections. 

The formatted text was then translated in Romanian by a small Kotlin module written by **LiviuSo**, that queries OpenAI GPT-4 model.

The developmemt of a comparative text editor is intended to facilitate the revision and the lecture of the translation. The editor would also allow notes and annotations on the text.

Also, **LiviuSo** intends to add the original Sanskrit verses as the translation of Kisari Mohan Ganguli seems to follow candidly the orinal text in Sanskrit.


I humbly dedicate this project to my dear and inspiring TM teacher, Adela, and to all those who seek wisdow in this wonderful holy book.

Namaste!
