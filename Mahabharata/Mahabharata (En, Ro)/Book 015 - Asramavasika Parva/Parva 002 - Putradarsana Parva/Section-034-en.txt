SECTION 34

Sauti said, "Hearing this story of the re-appearance and departure of his forefathers, king Janamejaya of great intelligence became highly pleased. Filled with joy, he once more questioned Vaisampayana on the subject of the reappearance of dead men, saying,--'How is it possible for persons whose bodies have been destroyed to re-appear in those very forms?' Thus asked, that foremost of regenerate persons, viz., the disciple of Vyasa, that first of speakers, possessed of great energy, thus answered Janamejaya.

"Vaisampayana said, 'This is certain, viz., that acts are never destroyed (without their consequences being enjoyed or endured). Bodies, O king, are born of acts; so also are features. The great primal elements are eternal (indestructible) in consequence of the union with them of the Lord of all beings. They exist with what is eternal. Accordingly, they have no destruction when the non-eternal are destroyed. Acts done without exertion are true and foremost, and bear real fruit. The soul, united however with such acts as require exertion for their accomplishment, enjoys pleasure and pain.[50] Though united so (that is, with pleasure and pain), yet it is a certain inference that the soul is never modified by them, like the reflection of creatures in a mirror. It is never destroyed.[51] As long as one's acts are not exhausted (by enjoyment or endurance of their fruits good and bad), so long does one regard the body to be oneself. The man, however, whose acts have been exhausted, without regarding the body to be self, takes the self to be something otherwise.[52] Diverse existent objects (such as the primal elements and the senses, etc.) attaining to a body, become united as one. To men of knowledge who understand the difference (between the body and self), those very objects become eternal.[53] In the Horse-sacrifice, this Sruti is heard in the matter of the slaying of the horse. Those which are the certain possessions of embodied creatures, viz., their life-breaths (and the senses, etc.), exist eternally even when they are borne to the other world. I shall tell thee what is beneficial, if it be agreeable to thee, O king. Thou hast, while employed in thy sacrifices, heard of the paths of the deities. When preparations were made for any sacrifice of thine, the deities became beneficially inclined to thee. When indeed, the deities were thus disposed and came to thy sacrifices, they were lords in the matter of the passage (from this to the next world) of the animals slain.[54] For this reason, the eternal ones (viz., Jivas), by adoring the deities in sacrifices, succeed in attaining to excellent goals. When the five primal elements are eternal, when the soul also is eternal, he called Purusha (viz., the soul invested with case) is equally so. When such is the case, he who beholds a creature as disposed to take diverse forms, is regarded as having an erroneous understanding. He who indulges in too much grief at separation is, I think, a foolish person. He who sees evil in separation should abandon union. By standing aloof, no unions are formed, and sorrow is cast off, for sorrow in the world is born of separation.[55] Only he who understands the distinction between body and self, and not another, becomes freed from the erroneous conviction. He that knows the other (viz., self) attains to the highest understanding and becomes freed from error.[56] As regards creatures. they appear from an invisible state, and once more disappear into invisibleness. I do not know him. He also does not know me. As regards myself, renunciation is not yet mine.[57] He that is not possessed of puissance enjoys or endures the fruits of all his acts in those too dies in which he does them. If the act be a mental one, its consequences are enjoyed or endured mentally; if it be done with the body, its consequences are to be enjoyed or endured in the body.'"[58]


Footnotes:

50. Nilakantha explains that anayasakritani karma implies the religion ofNivritti, for the religion of Pravritti consists of acts that requireayasa or exertion for their accomplishment. The religion of Nivritti orabstention from acts is said hereto be true and superior, and productiveof real fruit, in the form, that is, of Emancipation. The soul, however,in the generality of cases, united with ebhih, by which is meantayasa-kritam karma, that is, the acts done in pursuance of the religionof Pravritti, becomes embodied and, therefore, enjoys happiness orendures misery as the case may be.

51. The sense seems to be this--when a creature stands before a mirror,its image is formed in the mirror; such reflection, however, neveraffects the mirror in the least, for when the object leaves the vicinityof the mirror, the image or reflection vanishes away. The soul is likethe mirror. Pleasure and pain are like reflections in it. They come andgo away without the soul being at all modified by them in anyway.Pleasure and pain are destructible, but not so the soul.

52. The ordinary man thinks this conglomeration of diverse objects to behis self. The man of wisdom who has exhausted his acts does not think so.He is freed from the obligation of taking a body.

53. The sense probably is this. In the case of ordinary men, thecomponent parts of the body dissolve away, while Yogins can keep suchparts from dissolution as long as they like.

54. The sense is, the deities bear away to the next world the animalsslain in sacrifices. Though the bodies of such animals are apparentlydestroyed, yet their life-breaths and senses continue to exist.

55. The sense is that as wives etc., when lost, are sources of sorrow,wise men should abstain from contracting such relations. They might thenbe free from sorrow.

56. Paraparajnah is one that understands the distinction between body andsell. Apara is, therefore, one that is not possessed of such knowledge;hence, as Nilakantha explains, it implies one who has not attained toJnana nishtha. What is said in the second line is that he that adoressaguna Brahma, succeeds afterwards, through such adoration, in reachingto nirguna Brahma.

57. The sense seems to be this: we spring from the unmanifest anddisappear once more in the unmanifest. The Bengal texts read the firstline incorrectly. It is adarsanalapatitah. The second line isunintelligible. Naham tam vedini is taken by Nilakantha as implying 'I donot know him,' i.e., him that is Emancipate. Asau cha no vetti mam isexplained as a due to karanabhat. But who is asau? 'I have norenunciation,' or 'renunciation is not yet mine,' implies thatEmancipation, which directly flows from renunciation, is not mine.

58. What is stated here is that if a man does an act that is bad, itsconsequences he will have to endure in a human body. The same with regardto rewards. By doing a meritorious act in one's human form, one willenjoy its good consequences in one's human body. So acts done mentallyaffect the mind and those done with the body affect the body.It should be noted that the whole of the above translation is offeredtentatively. A verbal rendering has been attempted. The chain ofreasoning is not at all clear. The commentator has done much to elucidatethe sense, but the original obscurities have scarcely been removed.
