### **The fundamentals of Ayurveda**

Before  starting,  and  to  put  you  in  the  best  mindset  possible,  we  must  make  one  crucial  point: Ayurvedic treatments and Western allopathic medicine have two very different visions of the world, of the individual, and of disease.As  individuals  born  into  a  Western  culture  full  of  logical  deduction,  systematization,  and  never-ending  quests  for  proof,  learning  Ayurveda  - which  is  based  on  case-by-case  care,  4,000-year-old writings, intuition, and a different cosmology - may seem difficult, even impossible if one does not start with the right state of mind.As  such,  you  must  keep  an  open  mind,  free  of  all  judgment,  past  beliefs  and  certainties,  and  be  eager  to  learn.  If  you  want  to  reassure  your  logical  mind,  remember  that  Ayurveda  has  been  practiced  for  over  4,000  years,  and  thus  is  a  proven  discipline.  Nowadays,  the  World  Health  Organization, a large number of Western universities and doctors are all taking a keen interest in it. Warning - Ayurvedic treatment should in no case replace allopathic medicine, but instead be used in conjunction with it. We strongly recommend the use of Ayurveda only as an adjunct to a physician’s care.

**Definition**

Etymologically, Ayurveda is made up of the two Sanskrit words: Ayur, life and longevity, and Veda, wisdom,  and  knowledge.  This  term  could,  therefore,  be  translated  as  "knowledge  of  life  and  longevity."Its origin dates back more than 5,000 years. It took root at the time of the Indian Vedic civilization. This civilization was based on the **Vedas**, a collection of ancient texts gathering knowledge revealed to the Rishis, the Indian sages, during their meditations.This  knowledge  dealt  with  the  functioning  of  the  body,  with  astrology,  and  with  the  physical  sciences. Following their revelation, they were orally transmitted by wise men to their disciples, in the  form  of  Sutras,  songs,  and  rhythmic  texts.  This  oral  transfer  lasted  thousands  of  years  and  still  takes place today. As  part  of  the  Vedas,  Ayurveda,  is  considered  eternal  and  not  created  by  man.  Eternal,  for  it  was  derived from nature and the universe, and therefore will always be true. Not created by man, for it was revealed to the Rishis.

Ayurveda aims to accomplish three goals:

- Cure sickness
- Maintain health
- Self-actualization

We cannot think of it in the way we do Western allopathic medicine. While the West has a science based  on  tests  and  evidence,  which  aims  to  find  a  cure  for  each  disease,  Ayurveda  is  more  of  a  lifestyle and a way of perceiving our body, mind, and spirit as a united whole. Ayurveda, therefore, aims to nourish us, treat us, and lift us up.

**Samkhya Philosophy**

Ayurveda  is  not  just  a  science  of  the  human  body.  It  is  also  a  way  of  perceiving  Life  and  the  Universe.  It  includes  religious  and  philosophical  aspects.  While  we  are  free  to  adhere  to  the  fundamental principles of Ayurveda we must accept them, free of all judgment in order to be able to assimilate them.The spiritual part of Ayurveda is the Samkhya philosophy. Its name is taken from the Sanskrit word sat: truth  and  khya: to  know.  According  to  this  philosophy,  the  source  of  all  of  existence  is  the  Cosmic Consciousness that manifests itself in all of the universe via masculine energy: Purusha, and feminine energy: Prakruti. These two energies are described as eternal, immeasurable, and existing outside  of  space  and  time.  They  are  present  in  every  object  in  the  universe,  whether  animate  or  inanimate.Purusha  is  the  energy  of  the  pure,  passive  consciousness.  It  has  no  structure  or  attributes.  It  is  existence  in  its  simplest,  purest  form.  It  is  without  active  manifestation  and  without  the  notion  of  cause and effect. It does not participate in the creation or evolution of the universe but remains the silent witness.Prakruti  is  the  active  opposite,  decision-making  energy.  It  manifests  itself  in  colors  and  forms.  It  is  the  Divine  creator  energy.  She  is  the  One  who  becomes  multiple.  She  is  the  Divine  Mother  of  the  Universe. Apart from the creation of all that surrounds us, Prakruti is also the energy that drives us in  the  form  of  the  Ego:  Ahamkar, which  divides  itself  into  three  fundamental  energies  or  Gunas: Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. But we will see this in more detail later in this module.

**Consideration of the human being**

In  Ayurvedic  treatment, everything is connected: the individual, his environment, his thoughts, his sickness,  his  way  of  behaving,  etc.  The  individual  himself  is  always  seen  as  Body-Mind-Spirit together.  These  three  elements  are  interdependent,  and  unable  to  exist  without  each  other. Thinking of one of them in isolation from one another would not make sense in Ayurveda.In  the  same  manner,  we  cannot  separate  the  individual  from  his  environment.  This  is  one  of  the  basic  rules  of  Ayurveda:  everything  that  appears  and  happens  in  the  external  realm  (macrocosm)  also exists, appears, and occurs within every being in this realm (microcosm). Humans, as a product of  Cosmic  Consciousness,  or  Prakruti,  are  made  of  the  same  elements  and  energies  as  everything  else that exists in the Universe.

**Holistic Vision**

In  Ayurveda,  it  is  believed  that  each  person,  that  is,  every  body-soul  -spirit,  constitutes  a  unique  whole  in  the  Universe.  This  is  similar  to  the  way  modern  science  has  been  able  to  prove  the  uniqueness of the DNA of each individual. In  Ayurvedic treatment, this uniqueness is always taken into consideration, and every individual will have a unique prescription because what will work for one will not necessarily work for another.As such, we do not aim to treat an illness with its own treatment, but rather to restore the state of health and prevent diseases, by giving each person his own specific treatment.

**State of Health/Illness**

We must first accept that the natural state of the body is good health. Although we are constantly bombarded  by  allergens,  viruses,  and  bacteria,  our  body  does  its  best  to  maintain  our  state  of  health,  that  is  to  say,  a  state  of  perfect  homeostasis  and  balance  of  our  energies,  as  we  will  see  in  the following sections.Regardless  of  our  choices  and  behavior,  there  are  environmental  factors  that  can  harm  our  ideal  functioning.  An  unbalanced  diet,  stress,  or  fatigue  can  upset  our  balance  and  stop  our  body  from  naturally restoring itself.

**Associated Disciplines**

Because the individual is the sum of Body-Mind-Spirit, we must address each of these three aspects to  reach  the  goals  of  perfect  health  and  self-actualization.  And  this  does  not  happen  just  through  Ayurveda. According to the Rishis, it is the combined practice of the ancient disciplines of Ayurveda, Yoga and Tantra, that would allow us to achieve a perfect balance. Each of these practices covers a different and well-defined aspect of this quest for knowledge, well-being, and longevity.

* Yoga is defined as the science of the Union with the Divine, it is the domain of the Mind and of Awareness.
* Tantra  is  the  most  direct  way  to  control  the  energies  that  drive  us.  This  is  the  domain  of  the  Soul.
* Ayurveda, finally, the science of Life, teaches us how to take care of our body.

According  to  the  Vedas,  practicing  Tantra  and  Yoga  requires  enormous  diligence,  knowledge,  and  discipline. For this reason, they cannot be practiced right off the bat. Ayurveda, on the other hand, can  be  practiced  in  everyday  life  by  everyone.  It  creates  a  knowledge  of  the  body  and  the  mind  necessary to practice the other two disciplines.These  three  disciplines  are  therefore  very  closely  linked;  they  should  not  be  seen  as  independent  but as three parts of the same whole. By the way, it is necessary to understand the foundations of Ayurveda to know how to use Yoga and Tantra.

Now  that  we  understand  what  Ayurveda  is,  its  goal,  and  its  vision  of  the  individual,  we  will  get  to  the heart of this subject a bit more in the second part of this module. For example, we will see what constitutes  the  individual  and  the  universe  and  which  energies  dictate  our  state  of  health,  mood,  and behavior. A note concerning the use of Sanskrit: As you may have already realized, most of the terms in this course   are   both   in   English   and   in   Sanskrit.   We   made   this   choice   because   before   being   a   methodology  of  remedies,  Ayurveda  deals  with  words.  You  see,  Ayurveda  was  not  merely  an  oral  tradition, but people believed in the healing power of words of the sacred language, of prayers, of mantras, and in the strength of affirmations. Furthermore, Sanskrit is a language of incomparable refinement, richness, and precision. It is often difficult,  even  impossible  to  translate.  Each  book  you’ll  read  will  give  you  different  English  translations,  approxiMorningg  more  or  less  the  original  terms.  Nevertheless,  they  will  all  give  you  the same Sanskrit terms, allowing you to then connect from one book to another.

**The Three States of Energy**

According  to  Samkhya  philosophy,  every  object  in  the  universe  has  three  states  of  energy  called  Gunas, "the links that connect us to the physical world." These states, **Sattva Guna**, **Rajas Guna**, and **Tamas Guna**, could respectively be translated as balance, movement, and inertia. Learning  to  spot  the  predominant  Guna  in  an  individual  contributes  to  the  understanding  of  their  physical and physiological functioning. The Gunas are thus essential to Ayurveda. You will need to know their main characteristics and thoroughly understand their function.

**SATTVA GUNA - Balance**

Sattva  represents  a  state  of  perfect  balance.  On  the  scale  of  the  Universe,  Sattva  is  the  creative  force  of  the  god  Brahma.  We  can  distinguish  this  Guna  by  the  state  of  serenity,  awakening  of  consciousness, intelligence, creativity, and wisdom that characterize an object that is dominated by Sattva  Guna.  Thus,  in  the  individual,  it  is  manifested  by  virtues  of  humility,  honesty,  search  for  truth, tolerance, and peace.Sattva  is  the  state  towards  which  we  must  strive  to  achieve  the  health,  longevity,  and  happiness  targeted by Ayurveda. And this energy state of great stability is achieved by the right balance of the following two Gunas.

**RAJAS GUNA - Movement**

Rajas is the energy of physical movement: it is psychomotor restlessness that we may experience in states  of  stress  such  as,  for  example,  when  pacing.  Rajas  is  the  need  to  let  off  steam,  and  release  excess energy. It is also psychic energy: the creation of troubles, emotions, and feelings. The predominance of this Guna over the other two gives the individual an authoritarian, proud and ambitious character as well as a strong need for control, a difficulty to rest and to calm down. In the Universe, Rajas Guna represents the protective force of the god Vishnu.

**TAMAS GUNA - Inertia**

Tamas  is  inertia,  idleness,  difficulty  in  feeling  something,  and  apathy.  This  state  is  represented  by  darkness  and  shows  itself  in  people  by  egocentricity,  difficult  access  to  spirituality,  a  tendency  to  depression,  sarcasm,  and  a  degree  of  awkwardness.  In  the  universe,  Tamas  is  the  destructive  energy of Mahesha. Anything that increases Sattva is considered to be of great value to the mind. By contrast, anything that  reduces  it  or  that  increases  Rajas  or  Tamas  should  be  moderated.  This  can  happen  through  food. Certain foods like rice, almonds, ghee, milk, and honey which all increase Sattva.  The  foods  that  increase  Rajas  are  red  meat,  as  well  as  foods  that  are  overly  salty,  acidic,  hot,  or  spicy.  If  the  food  leaves  a  burning  sensation,  it  increases  Rajas.  The  foods  that  increase  Tamas  include alcohol, processed or low-quality foods, and leftovers.

**The Five Elements**

As we have seen, the natural forces of the macrocosm –sun, moon, rain, space, planets, stars, wind, earth – are  present  in  the  body  in  a  slightly  modified  form.  And  what  happens  externally  has  consequences internally. But what is the macrocosm made of? This is how the Universe and its essential elements were formed, according to the revelations that were  made  to  the  Rishis:  In  the  beginning,  there  was  the  Cosmic  Consciousness  which  began  to  vibrate.  As  its  vibrations  propagated  in  the  first  element,  the  Ether,  they  created  Sound.  Ether  under the effect of these phenomena began to move, and thus created Air, the second element.The movement of Air created friction, and from this friction, came heat. The heat particles clashing together  created  sparks.  Then  an intense light, and so Fire was born, the third element.  Under its high temperature, some of Ether’s particles liquefied and became Water, the fourth element, then solidified and became Earth, the fifth element.

Ether   is,   therefore,   the   first   fundamental  element,  from  which  the  four  other  fundamental  elements  were  born:  Air,  Fire,  Water,  and  Earth.  Everything  in  the  universe  is  formed  of  different  proportions  of  these  five  elements:  Earth,  Water,  Fire,  Air,  and  Ether.  Each  of  these  elements  is  itself considered a whole which includes the other four elements to a lesser extent.  Take Water for example: In its solid state (ice), the Earth element is predominant, but by warming it with the Fire it contains, it melts and returns to its liquid state. When the Fire’s effect intensifies, it turns  into  vapor,  and  thus  Air  is  the  dominant  element.  Then,  it  evaporates  and  disappears,  becoming Ether.If  we  go  back  to  the  origin,  the  fundamental  elements  are  the  product  of  the  vibratory  energy  produced by Cosmic Consciousness. They form all existing matter: thus, matter is energy. Now  let's  take  a  closer  look  at  the  human  body.  As  we  have  seen,  the  individual  is  a  microcosm  composed of five fundamental elements of the universe. Let’s see how they manifest in us.

**Aakash : Ether**

Ether,  the  first  element,  represents  the  empty  space,  the  space  that  can  be  filled,  the  one  that  is  organized  in  our  body  into  a  network  of  large  arteries  and  tiny  vessels,  as  well  as  the  mouth,  the  nose, the trachea, chest, abdomen, or cells. Because this is how sound and vibrations are made, it is connected to hearing. The ear is its sensory organ, and the phonatory apparatus is its motor organ.

**Vaayu : Air**

Air,  the  second  element,  is  an  invisible  force  that  creates  visible  changes.  It  imparts  muscular  movement, the heartbeat, the expansion and contraction of the lungs, and intestinal movements... Air is associated with touch, the skin is its sensory organ, and the hand is its motor organ.

**Agni : Fire**

Fire, the third element, is the origin of  the  metabolism.  It  is  located  in  the  digestive  system  and  in  the  gray  matter  and  cells  of  the  brain.  It  manifests  itself  through  intelligence.  The  processes  of  digestion, thought, regulation of body temperature, as well as sight, are governed by this element. Since light is perceived by the retina, Fire is associated with sight. The eye is its sensory organ, and the  foot  is  its  motor  organ.  Indeed,  the  foot  allows  us  to  move,  but  it  needs  the  eye  to  decide  in  which direction.

**Jal : Water**

Water,  the  fourth  element,  is  in  our  digestive  secretions,  salivary  glands,  mucus,  plasma,  and  the  cytoplasm  of  our  cells.  Water  is  associated  with  taste,  so  its  sensory  organ  is  the  tongue,  and  its  motor  organ  is  the  reproductive  apparatus.  In  Ayurveda,  the  genital  tract  is  sometimes  called  the  lower tongue, as it is believed that these two organs are linked.

**Prithvi : Earth**

Earth,  the  fifth  element,  is  the  only  solid  one.  It  is  predominantly  in  our  bones,  cartilage,  nails,  muscles,  tendons,  skin,  and  hair.  It  is  associated  with  the  sense  of  smell.  The  sensory  organ  is  the  nose,  and  the  motor  organ  is  the  anus  due  to  its  excretion  function.  The  rishis  found  that  constipated people generally had respiratory discomfort and a different sense of smell.

**The Three doshas**

In Ayurveda,  everything  in  the  universe,  including  the  human  body,  is  composed  of  the  five  basic  elements.  They  each  predominate  in  different  organs,  giving  them  their  essential  characteristics.  They  also  intervene  as  energy  in  all  the  processes  of  the  body.  These  vital  and  functional  energies  are formed by elements grouped in pairs and are called doshas.As such, Ether and Air form the Vata dosha. Fire and Water join together to form Pitta. And Water and  Earth  together  form  Kapha.  These  doshas  are  present  at  all  levels  in  the  body,  in  all  of  our  tissues,  organs,  and  cells.  They  completely  govern  our  psychobiological  functions.  They  are  the  source of our desires, our tastes, our choices, and our way of behaving and interacting. At the physical level, they intervene in all the processes of creation, maintenance or destruction of tissues, as well as in the elimination of waste. They are also the source of our emotions. Therefore, when balanced, they create a state of perfect physical health and make us the best possible version of  ourselves.  On  the  other  hand,  when  they  are  imbalanced,  they  cause  illness  and  bring  out  our  worst faults through the emotions of fear, anger, and selfishness.At the time of conception, when a male gamete fertilizes a female gamete, each individual inherits a doshic constitution, resulting from the mixture of both parents. This basic constitution will remain unchanged  throughout  our  lives,  but  its  expression  will  change  under  the  influence  of  our  environment and our choices.One  of  the  fundamental  principles  of  Ayurveda  is  that  everyone  can  create  and  maintain  the  balance  of  their  internal  forces  by  changing  their  diet  and  lifestyle,  to  counterbalance  changes  in  their external environment.

**Vata -  Catabolism**

This  dosha  is  formed  of  the  elements  Air  and  Ether,  it  allows  the  setting  in  motion.  Everything  related to movement in the body is therefore called Vata. It will enable, for example, the blinking of the  eye,  breathing,  muscular  movements,  heartbeat,  and  nerve  impulses  as  well  as  psychicmovements, feelings, and emotions.This list is not exhaustive. Indeed, each dosha is itself divided into five sub-doshas. We will describe them in detail in a future module. For this chapter, the most important things to remember are the elements to which are attached the doshas, the major type of reactions they cause, and where they are located.Vata is predominant in all catabolic reactions of the body, meaning all types of deterioration. In the human  body,  this  includes  the  large  intestine,  the  pelvic  cavity,  the  bones,  the  skin,  the  ears,  and  the  thighs.  These  areas,  called  "seats,"  are  occupied  primarily  by  Vata.  Thus,  when  there  is  an  excess  of  this  dosha  in  the  body,  it  is  in  these  places  that  we  can  find  the  signs  of  too  much  Vata  and be able to confirm or invalidate our diagnosis.

**Pitta -  Metabolism**

Pitta  is  formed  of  the  elements  of  Fire  and  Water.  It  controls  the  metabolic  functions  of  the  body,  that  is  to  say,  the  balance  of  catabolism  and  anabolism.  Pitta’s  functions  include  absorption, assimilation,  digestion,  regulation  of  body  temperature,  skin  color,  brightness  of  the  eyes,  and  intelligence.In  terms  of  emotions,  when  we  have  an  excess  of  this  dosha,  we  experience  jealousy,  anger,  and  hate.  Pitta’s  seats  are  the  small  intestine,  the  stomach,  the  sweat  glands,  the  blood,  the  fat,  the  eyes, and the skin.

**Kapha -  Anabolism**

Kapha  is  the  synthesis  of  the  elements  Water  and  Earth.  It  is  predominant  in  all  the  anabolic  functions  of  the  organism,  that  is  to  say  in  all  the  functions  of  creation,  growth,  and  repair.  It  imparts strength, vigor, stability, resistance of the body tissues, and energy to the heart and lungs. It also helps with memorization, joint lubrication, hydration of the skin, healing of wounds, and the immune system. At  the  emotional  level,  it  is  responsible  for  the  emotions  of  attachment  and  greed  and  produces  feelings of calm, forgiveness, and love. Its seats are the torso, the throat, the head, the sinuses, the nose,  the  mouth,  the  stomach,  the  cell  cytoplasm,  the  plasma,  and  the  liquid  secretions  of  the  body.

Here  is  a  table  to  summarize  what  we  have  just  learned,  and  to  provide  some  additional  information:

![Doshas](../Ayurveda%20Practicioner/images/module01-01-doshas.png)

**The 7 Constitutions**

There are seven possible constitutions for a human being:

* Vata
* Pitta

* Kapha
* Vata-Pitta

* Pitta-Kapha
* Vata-Kapha

* Vata-Kapha-Pitta

A  multitude  of  shades  exists  within  these  seven  combinations.  This  is  because  the  proportions  of  the three doshas always vary from one individual to the next, even when they have the same basic constitution.  The  constitution  of  each  individual  is  therefore  unique,  in  the  same  way  that  every  human has two hands with five fingers, but his own unique fingerprints.As  we  explained  above,  even  if  an  individual’s  constitution  remains  the  same  from  birth  to  death,  the  expression  of  this  can  vary  based  on  external  factors.  This  expression  will  change  mostly  because of the body’s age. Thus, in childhood, the anabolic functions, and therefore the proportion of Kapha, increase: we are in a growth phase. In  adulthood,  our  body,  having  reached  maturity,  is  in  a  state  of  stability.  At  that  time  Pitta  predominates. In old age, the body deteriorates, so Vata and the catabolic functions dominate.

**The 20 Characteristics: Ayurvedic Care essentials**

Now that we know a bit more about the doshas and understand that their being balanced is good for  us,  we  are  going  to  see  a  tool  that  will  help  balance  them.  To  use  it,  keep  in  mind  that,  unlike  homeopathic medicine - which treats ailments with small doses of natural substances, and which in large  quantities  would  cause  the  same  symptoms  as  those  treated  - in  Ayurveda,  a  disease  is  treated with remedies corresponding to the opposite characteristics.

To  help  choose  an  effective  treatment,  20  qualities  have  been  defined.  They  are  given  in  pairs  of  opposites:

* Heavy Guru –   Laghu Light
* Slow Manda –   Tikshna Hasty

* Cold Shita –   Ushna Hot
* Oily Snigdha –   Ruksha Dry

* Sticky Slakshna –   Khara Rough
* Thick Sandra –   Drava Liquid

* Soft Mrudu –   Kathina Hard
* Stationary Sthira –   Chala Mobile

* Subtle Sukshma –   Sthula Crass
* Murky Avila –   Vishada Clear

These qualities apply to both internal and external elements. So our constitution, our dosha, can be affected  by  external  changes.  For  example,  Vata  will  increase  in  cold,  windy  (moving),  and  dry  weather.  This  may  lead  to  colds  or  other  ailments  specific  to  Vata,  such  as  insomnia,  constipation,  and arthritis.Pitta will be increased by hot, humid weather, which can lead to irritability and anger, as well as to acne and eczema. Rainy weather (liquid) or cloudy (murky) aggravates Kapha, causing coughing, as well as lethargy, depression, and the tendency to overeat and oversleep.According to Ayurvedic principles, each one of the qualities of one pair influences the other. If they are similar, they reinforce each other. If they are opposite, they weaken each other.As such, in our treatments, if a person presents an excess of Pitta, and therefore Fire, manifesting itself  by  heat,  we  will  seek  coolness:  drinks,  baths,  poultice  with  refreshing  herbs...  One  will  thus  attempt  to  soothe  Pitta  and  reduce  the  heat.  These  solutions  seem  evident  because  they  are  natural and straightforward. And that’s what makes them so effective. In Ayurveda, the answer to a problem always makes sense and is easy to justify.
