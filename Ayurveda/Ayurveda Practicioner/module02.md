### FLAVORS AND CONSTITUTIONS

#### The Three Doshas and the Six Flavors

We  will  soon  discover  the  precise  characteristics  of  individuals  based  on  their  personality  type,  which  is  known  in  Ayurveda  as  their  Dosha.  As  we  saw  in  the  previous  module,  there  are  three  types: Vata,  Pitta,  and  Kapha.  These  combine  in  each  of  us  to  form our deep nature, our Prakriti, which  makes  each  individual  unique.  This  is  the  result  of  our  particular  balance  of  the  different  doshas that compose us.After having differentiated the different types of personalities, we will show you a test to determine the  deep  nature  (Prakriti)  of  people  who  wish  to  benefit  from  Ayurvedic  treatments.  But  before  that,  we  must  define  the  six  flavors  (Rasas)  that  are  known  in  Ayurveda.  This  will  be  useful  in  the  following chapters.

#### **The Rasas, or the Six Flavors**

The  Rasas  characterize  all  foods.  The  fact  that  we  crave  one  or  the  other  more  can  give  us  clues  about our doshic constitution. In Ayurveda, foods are classified according to these flavors, and not according  to  their  composition  in  terms  of  carbohydrates,  proteins,  vitamins,  etc.  Here  again,  Ayurvedic  medicine  encourages  us  to  trust  our  feelings,  senses,  and  body  to  tell  us  what  is  and  is  not good for us. These six flavors are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. The first three are perceived by  the  taste  buds,  whereas  the  last  two  are  more  recognizable  by  the  sensations  they  cause.  Indeed, pungent and astringent are perceived by other receptors and leave more vague sensations like heat, irritation, dryness, etc.The  first  three  flavors  help  the  anabolic  functions,  that  is  to  say,  anything  having  to  do  with  the  growth  or  reinforcement  of  tissues  and  organs  in  the  body.  As  for  the  astringent,  bitter,  and  pungent flavors, they help the catabolic functions, that is to say, elimination and degradation.These  flavors,  or  Rasas,  can  be  classified  according  to  the  following  qualities:  heat,  coolness,  humidity, heaviness, dryness, and lightness. It is essential to know the principal properties of food because,  in  Ayurveda,  food  is  the  most  important  medicine.  An  Ayurvedic  proverb  even  says,  “a good  medicine  without  a  good  diet  is  ineffective,  and  a  good  diet  has  no  need  for  medicine.”  Now, as we have seen in the previous module, in Ayurveda, treatment is done with remedies that have the opposite qualities to the ailment. So...The hottest flavor is pungent, followed by sourThe most cooling flavor is bitter, followed by astringentThe wettest flavor is sweet, followed by saltyThe heaviest flavor is sweet, followed by saltyThe driest flavor is pungent, followed by bitterThe lightest flavor is bitter, followed by pungentTo  complete  this  brief  introduction  to  the  flavors,  remember  that  like  everything  in  the  universe,  the Rasas are formed of various combinations of the five fundamental elements. This explains their ability  to  strengthen  or  weaken  the  expression  of  one  of  our  doshas,  that  is  to  say,  a  facet  of  our  personality.

#### **The Six Rasas**

**Sweet** –  **Madhura**

This is the most nutritious taste for the blood plasma and body tissues. As such, it brings a sense of satisfaction to the body and the mind. This flavor is formed from Water and Earth and corresponds to  the  characteristics  of  the  dosha  Kapha,  itself  derived  from  these  two  elements.  This  flavor  will  aggravate  this  dosha  if  consumed  in  excess.  The  characteristics  that  are  conferred  by  these  two  elements   are   coolness,   heaviness,   softness,   and   gentleness.   Sweetness   can   thus   cause   an   overproduction of mucus and urine, heaviness, and laziness, as well as slowing down digestion and decreasing  its  effectiveness.  This  flavor  facilitates  weight  gain  (sometimes  to  the  point  of  obesity),  nausea,  and  imbalance  of  the  gut  flora.  It  can  also  be  responsible  for  respiratory  and  lymphatic  problems.

**Sour taste – Amla**

This flavor often implies the presence of a multitude of vitamins and antioxidants in food. It gives us a clearer, livelier mind. It stimulates, and sometimes even irritates the digestive system. It can lead to inflammation. It is made of the elements Earth and Fire, so it is characterized by heat, softness, ability  to  strengthen  or  weaken  the  expression  of  one  of  our  doshas,  that  is  to  say,  a  facet  of  our  personality.

**Sweet –   Madhura**

This flavor is formed from Water and Earth and corresponds to  the  characteristics  of  the  dosha  Kapha,  itself  derived  from  these  two  elements.  This  flavor  will  aggravate  this  dosha  if  consumed  in  excess.  The  characteristics  that  are  conferred  by  these  two  elements   are   coolness,   heaviness,   softness,   and   gentleness.   Sweetness   can   thus   cause   an   overproduction of mucus and urine, heaviness, and laziness, as well as slowing down digestion and decreasing  its  effectiveness.  This  flavor  facilitates  weight  gain  (sometimes  to  the  point  of  obesity),  nausea,  and  imbalance  of  the  gut  flora.  It  can  also  be  responsible  for  respiratory  and  lymphatic  problems.

**Sour taste – Amla**

This flavor often implies the presence of a multitude of vitamins and antioxidants in food. It gives us a clearer, livelier mind. It stimulates, and sometimes even irritates the digestive system. It can lead to inflammation. It is made of the elements Earth and Fire, so it is characterized by heat, softness, and  lightness.  Because  of  its  composition,  it  can  aggravate  the  personality  traits  (or  doshas)  Pitta  and  Kapha  if  it  is  consumed  in  excess.  This  flavor  will  then cause an intense thirst, paleness of the skin,  cold  sensation  in  the  teeth,  itching,  skin  problems,  heartburn,  and  ulcers  in  the  digestive  system.  It  will  disrupt  the  vision  and  cause  coordination  problems  and  sluggishness  of  the  body.  However,  it  is  all  a  question  of  dosage.  Indeed,  in  reasonable  quantities,  a  sour  taste  can  calm  the  characteristics  of  the  dosha  Vata,  nourish  body  tissue,  help  digestion  and  absorption,  allow  the  breakdown  of  fatty  substances,  help  produce  saliva,  moisturize,  relax  body  tissue,  and  improve  bowel  movements.  Here  are  some  examples  of  typically  sour  foods:  tomatoes,  pineapples,  citrus  fruits, radishes, redcurrants, miso, wine, vinegar, sauerkraut, etc.

**Salty -   Lavana**

This is a flavor enhancer that stimulates digestion. It brings us firmness and structure and promotes stability.  Its  main  qualities  are  warmth,  heaviness,  and  softness  that  it  draws  from  the  two  fundamental elements composing it: Water and Fire. Due to this composition, it can aggravate the characteristics  resulting  from  the  Pitta  and  Kapha  doshas.  When  imbalanced,  salty  taste  can  cause  the sensation of thirst, water retention, elevated blood pressure, low energy levels, heartburn and ulcers, skin problems (by way of the obstruction of the pores), rheumatism, and gout. However, in small amounts, it can soothe Pitta. It calms the dosha Vata, improves our sense of taste sensitivity, maintains our hydration, and helps us produce more tears and saliva. It cleans the pores of the skin and liquefies the mucus of our body. Finally, it has a slight laxative effect. It is found in garlic, onion, leek, chive, coriander, tarragon, seaweed, seafood, salt, oats, barley, chestnut, etc.

**Pungent - Katu**

This flavor helps with digestion and the proper assimilation of nutrients by the body. It also makes our  minds  lively  and  agile.  This  Rasa  consists  of  the  elements  Fire  and  Air.  From  these  elements,  it  draws  the  following  properties:  hot,  dry,  and  light.  It  can,  therefore,  aggravate  the  characteristics  conferred by the Vata and Pitta doshas. It can cause a burning in the hands, feet, and stomach, as well as dryness of the throat and mouth. It can provoke an intense thirst and a generalized loss of strength. It can be the source of nerve inflammation and pain. However, in small quantities, it can appease  Vata,  as  well  as  Kapha.  It  allows  for  better  digestion  and  faster  metabolism,  helping  to  eliminate excess fat in the body and food. Also, it kills bacteria and parasites, makes the blood and mucus more fluid, relaxes body tissue, and relieves muscle contractions and cramps. Here are some examples  of  pungent  foods:  oregano,  basil,  thyme,  ginger,  horseradish,  mustard,  cinnamon,  nutmeg, and chili.

**Bitter - Tikta**

This  Rasa  is  an  excellent  purifier  for  the  mind.  It  is  said  to  be  sobering,  a  cleanser,  to  free  the  individual from his erotic impulses and his passions. It also helps to purify the body, for it contains coolness amongst its qualities, which allows us to eliminate hot toxins from the body. It is cold, dry, light, and subtle, and these  qualities  come  from  Air  and  Ether.  When  imbalanced,  it  will  aggravate  Vata and hide the other flavors. It will then also decrease body mass, dry out and harden the skin, cause constipation, weight loss, and a general state of weakness.On  the  other  hand,  it  can  appease  Pitta  and  Kapha.  It  cleanses  the  mouth  and  throat,  quenches  thirst,  stimulates  appetite  and  digestion,  and  protects  and  cleanses  the  liver.  It  also  decreases  fat,  excess fluid, and toxins. It contributes to healthy skin, improves memory and  intelligence,  relieves nausea,  and  eliminates  bacteria  and  parasites.  This  taste  is  dominant  in  leafy  greens:  arugula,  endive,  cabbage,  spinach,  broccoli,  etc.  It  is  also  found  in  roots,  such  as  turnips  or  Jerusalem  artichokes.

**Astringent –Kashaya**

This flavor dries, tightens, and contracts. It is an excellent purgative, invigorating for the mind, and particularly recommended in case of excess of Kapha. It helps us refocus. It is made of the elements Air  and  Earth,  so  it  is  cold,  dry,  heavy,  and  rough.  When  imbalanced,  it  aggravates  Vata.  The  following symptoms can then be found: numbness of the tongue, feeling of closed throat, tightness in the chest, clogged pores, dryness and tightness of the skin, intense feeling of thirst, lowering of the  quantity  of  liquid  produced,  and  difficult  bowel  movements.  However,  it  can  appease  Kapha  and Pitta. It will then improve the quality of the blood and the skin, invigorate our tissues, help heal wounds and ulcers, help clear up hardened masses (abscesses) and toxins, dry out excess moisture and  oiliness,  and  assure  a  proper  expulsion  of  stools  and  flatulence.  This  flavor  can  be  found  in  lemons, strawberries, sprouts, legumes, and tea.

### Food Composition

Each food includes many flavors combined in different proportions. Indeed, in every food, we find a principal  Rasa  and  a  secondary  Rasa,  called  Anurasa.  For  example,  lemon's  Rasa  is  sour,  and  its  Anurasa is astringent. Apple’s Rasa is sour and sweet, and its Anurasa is astringent.

### **Characteristics of Individuals According to their Dosha**

**Characteristics of Vata**

Vata people have a physique that could be described as thin, with undeveloped muscles, hips, and narrow  shoulders.  Their  bodies  are  flexible,  light,  and  often  seem  too  small.  These  people  usually  have difficulty gaining weight. Their hair is fine, often curly or even frizzy, and they do not have a lot of it.The eyes of Vata individuals are small and, producing few tears, they suffer from an uncomfortable dryness.  Their  joints  sometimes  crack  for  lack  of  lubrication.  Their skin is dry with the tendency to break,  forming  calluses.  It  is  often  cold  to  the  touch.  With  regard  to  “Malas”  (bodily  excretions),  here too, we see dryness. These people sweat little, urinate little, and their stools are small and dry.Vata  individuals  thus  can  be  prone  to  constipation.  Their  digestive  equilibrium  is  fragile.  They  regularly suffer from bloating, hiccups, burps, and feelings of tightness in the throat. Their appetite is irregular and rather weak.They  usually  crave  vegetables,  salad,  and  soup,  but  also  greasy  and  hot  foods.  They  have  trouble  absorbing the nutrients from their diet. Vatas can sometimes develop an excessive need for control. The  term  Vata  is  derived  from  the  Sanskrit  word  meaning  to  move.  As such, we can quickly figure out  who  Vatas  are.  These  individuals  never  stay  in  one  place,  love  to  travel,  are  always  in  motion,  and  think  little  before  acting  which  can  sometimes  be  problematic  for  them.  Their  moods  change  quickly, and their beliefs are subject to regular questioning and other disruptions.Their  gait  is  quick,  and  they  always  seem  to  be  in  a  hurry.  They  may  even  have  tremors  and  involuntary  muscular  contractions.  Their  sexual  activity  is  often  intense,  but  male  Vatas  can  suffer  from premature ejaculation. They are very energetic, with a tendency toward hyperactivity, and do not  know  how  to  relax.  They  only  stop  when  they  are  exhausted,  and  even  then,  Vatas  have  difficulty listening to their bodies.As  such,  they  try  to  use  their  energy  to  the  maximum,  often  abusing  coffee  or  other  stimulants.  They   alternate   between   times   of   exaggerated   activity   and   nervousness,   and   times   of   total   exhaustion allowing them to sink into a heavy and restful sleep. Apart from these periods of fatigue, Vata  individuals  have  great  difficulty  going  to  sleep  and  are  often  prone  to  insomnia.  However,  when they are balanced, they wake up in a good mood, fresh and full of energy. They are “morning people.”In all respects, Vata individuals are highly sensitive. They feel their emotions very strongly, are  not  very  resistant  to  diseases  and  have  difficulty  tolerating  loud  noises.  Likewise,  pain  is  more  difficult  to endure for them than for others. To avoid pain, Vata individuals develop excessive fear, caution, and insecurities. They have a lot of trouble engaging for long periods and get bored quickly. They are creative types, endowed  with  a  great  imagination  and  lively  intelligence,  but  have  difficulty  with  memorization. When balanced, Vatas have a cheerful, enthusiastic personality, with a need to connect with others. They often talk fast and too much.They  are  also  very  sensitive  to  windy,  cold,  and  dry  climates,  which  they  do  not  tolerate  well.  The  cold  is  particularly  difficult  for  them,  as  they  generally  suffer  from  poor  circulation  to  their  hands  and feet. Oil massages are beneficial to them. They soothe the agitation of their nervous system as well  as  their  physical  and  mental  pain.  Finally,  these  spontaneous  beings  have  difficulty  creating  a  daily routine and tend to let their wants of the moment drive their actions.With  regard  to  Vata  women,  they  have  the  following  premenstrual  symptoms  when  imbalanced:  bloating, lower back pain, abdominal cramps, insomnia, anxiety, insecurities, and fear.In  short,  if  you  like  change,  if  fickleness  and  spontaneity  define  you,  you  are  probably  a  Vata  individual. For  more  clarity,  let  us  summarize  what  we  just  learned  in  the  form  of  a  table.  Remember  that  these  qualities  are  given  by  the  two  elements  that  compose  them,  which,  for  Vata,  are  Air  and  Ether. To keep their balance, they must stay warm, calm, and avoid eating raw and cold food. It is instead advised  that  they  eat  hot  and  slightly  spicy  foods,  establish  regular  daily  habits,  and  anchor  themselves in ritual.

**Characteristics of Pitta**

Pitta  constitution  patients  often  have  a  well-proportioned  body,  build,  size  and  are  of  average  weight.  They  are  more  muscular  than  Vata  individuals,  and  their  weight  is  generally  stable.  Their skin  is  rather  pale  and  thin,  their  eyes  are  often  light  (green,  gray,  hazel),  and  their  hair  is  rather  fine, silky, straight, and light. Redheaded people are always of pure Pitta constitution or dual (that is to say, Pitta, combined with one of two other doshas.) Their hair has a tendency to become gray early in life. They can also lose it: having thin hair or being bald  is  relatively  frequent  for  Pitta  individuals.  Their  skin,  like  their  hair,  is  also  soft  and  oily.  Pittas  blush easily, whether from sunburn, physical exertion, or shyness.  They  may  have  many  moles  or  freckles.  Their  eyes  are  larger  than  those  of  the  Vata,  as  well  as  wetter  and  with  a  tendency  to  shine.  Their  complexion  is  fresh,  and  they  are  often  considered  somewhat  "good  looking."  In  general,  their  physique  looks  well-honed  with  sharp  and  beautiful  features. With   regard   to   their   excretions,   or   Malas,   their   salivation   and   sweat   are   excessive,   often   accompanied by a strong body odor. Their urination and stools are produced in large quantity, and their stools are moist. Pittas do not often experience constipation.Pitta individuals have an excellent appetite, proper digestion, and high metabolism. They consume a large quantity of drink and food and have a pronounced taste for sweetness. Skipping a meal  or  being  hungry  will  trigger  great  irritability.  With  their  natural  tendency  to  confront  and  debate,  prepare yourself for a heated discussion if you are in the presence of a hungry Pitta.The  word  Pitta  is  derived  from  a  Sanskrit  term  meaning:  to  heat.  As  such,  Pitta  individuals  easily  have  fever,  heartburn,  nausea,  and  are  particularly  susceptible  to  inflammatory  diseases.  They  are  also very sensitive to heat and light, so they prefer dry, cool and calm climates.These  are  intense,  hotheaded  personalities  with  lots  of  charisma,  and  an  ability  to  impose  themselves.  They  easily  understand  and  retain  information,  are  intelligent,  very  orderly,  and  determined. As such, they often reach the goals they have set for themselves. They are occasionally conflicted and are very quick to anger, even if they manage to keep calm on the surface. They love success, and it’s important for them to show it to everyone.This  diffuse  side,  which  needs  to  expand  can  also  be  found  in  the  diseases  that  can  affect  them.  Indeed, they are prone to skin problems which spread on the body like eczema, shingles, and acne. If  their  dosha  is  imbalanced,  they  will  become  bossy,  perfectionists  to  the  extreme,  rigid  and  hard  on  themselves  and  their  family  and  friends.  They  can  be  very  cynical and  feel  uncontrollable  feelings of hate and anger.Despite  the  fire  in  them,  their  sexual  appetite  is  not  excessive.  They  can  use  their  sexuality  as  an  outlet for their anger or emotional overflow. Young Pitta women experience puberty and the start of  their  periods  early.  Pitta  premenstrual  syndrome  symptoms  include;  chest  sensitivity,  skin  breakouts, sometimes a burning sensation while urinating, and hot flashes. Sleep-wise,  Pittas  sleep  an  average  of  6-8  hours  at  a  time.  They  don’t  experience  any  particular issues,  but  they  may  neglect  to  listen  to  the  signs  of  fatigue  when  they  become  too  involved  or  even obsessed with their passions. Their vitality is enhanced in the evening. To  maintain  their  balance,  Pittas  must  avoid  excessive  heat  and  grease,  and  limit  salt.  They  are  advised to eat refreshing foods without spices, drink cold but not frozen beverages and exercise in the cool hours of the day.

**Characteristics of Kapha**

Kapha people have strong, vigorous bodies, and are of robust appearance. Their build is wide, and they  are  imposing  and  muscular.  They  tend  to  gain  weight  easily  and  have  trouble  losing  it.  Their  digestion,  metabolism,  and  bowel  movements  are  slow.  These  are  hardy  people,  who  are  quite  resistant to diseases.Their  skin  is  soft,  well  hydrated,  clammy,  and  cold  to  the  touch.  It  tends  to  be  oily.  Their  eyes  are  attractive, big, blue or dark brown, and overhung with long and thick eyebrows and eyelashes. Their hair is thick, full and wavy. It is also greasy. Their joints and their entire body for that matter have a good degree of hydration and lubrication. They  are  often  quite  flexible.  Their  digestion  is  slow,  their  thirst  and  appetite  are  stable  and  moderate.  Unlike  Pittas,  they  can  easily  miss  a  meal  or  work  on  an  empty  stomach  without  it  causing any problems.They  love  everything  sweet,  salty,  and  greasy.  Unfortunately,  this  is  what  increases  their  water  retention and propensity to gain weight. They will generally have longer lives than people of other doshas, except when they become unbalanced. In that case, they can easily become obese and see their  life  expectancy  significantly  decrease.  Their  Mala  is  moderate,  and  their  excretions  have  a  slow pace. This slowness and stability characterize everything about Kapha.Their   speech   is   slow,   even   monotonous,   their   movements   are   gentle   and   graceful,   their   comprehension  is  slow,  but  once  something  is  learned,  it’s  for  life.  Their  long-term  memory  is  exceptional. Similarly, in their sexuality, although Kaphas are difficult to get in the mood when they finally feel like it, they are very attentive partners. Unsurprisingly, their sleep is long and deep. In  case  of  imbalance,  the  risk  of  shutting  themselves  off  in  a  long,  deep  sleep  is  very  strong.  Upon  waking,  the  Kapha  usually  feel  dazed.  They  are  at  their  maximum  vitality  in  the  middle  of  the  day.  Generally, they don’t feel a strong desire to move and be active.Their    personality    is    gentle,    loving,    peaceful,    tolerant,    attentive,    stable,    confident,    and    compassionate.  They  are  very  helpful  to  those  around  them.  Kaphas  are  often  pious,  with  their  religious or spiritual faith deeply rooted in them. Besides, they are thrifty and not big spenders.They  do  not  tolerate  heavy,  humid,  cloudy,  or  cold  weather  very  well.  When  imbalanced,  they  generally suffer  from  water-related  problems:  colds,  sinusitis,  bronchitis,  etc.  Disharmony  in  a  Kapha individual causes jealousy, greed, envy, laziness, reactiveness, depression, and resistance to change.  It  also  causes  attachment  and  dependence  on  others:  Kapha  can  become  “clingy”  and  drown in their relationships.For  women,  premenstrual  syndrome  symptoms  are  accompanied  by  a  great  lethargy,  difficulty  in  managing  their  emotions,  higher  water  retention  and  greater  production  of  urine  and  vaginal  discharge than usual. To  be  in  balance,  it  is  advised  that  they  exercise  regularly,  not  lock  themselves  into  a  too  strict  routine,  but  instead  vary  their  activities,  and  eat  light  and  dry  foods.  They  should  avoid  heavy  meals, dairy products, and extremely cold or icy food and drinks.

**Characteristics of Dual Constitutions**

**Vata-Pitta** - Vata-Pitta  personalities  suffer  from  poor  blood  circulation.  They  are  cautious,  prefer  warm weather, but because of their Pitta side, they cannot handle too much heat for long periods. Physically, they are a fair mix of their two doshas: for example, they often have naturally wavy hair, which  is  a  mix  of  Pitta’s  straight  hair  and  Vata’s  curly  hair.  Their  personalities  are  changeable  and  alternate between Vata and Pitta characteristics. As such, under stress, anger follows fear and vice versa.   In case of imbalance, Pittas’ natural need for control combined with Vatas’ lack of confidence drives them  to  an  internal  compromise:  exercising  overwhelming  authority  over  those  they  perceive  as  weaker  than  them.  When  balanced,  the  creative  side  of  Pitta  and  the  ingenious  side  of  Vata  combine, and give them the ability to brilliantly carry out projects which may seem a little crazy or even impossible to the rest of the world!The  common  qualities  of  Pitta  and  Vata  are  lightness  and  intensity.  It  is  important  to  direct  this intensity into something positive, such as personal development because otherwise, Vata-Pittas can succumb  to  addictions.  The  stable,  quiet  and  laid-back  side  of  Kapha  is  something  that  is  sorely  lacking, and that they must try to add to their lives to stay in balance.

**Pitta-Kapha** – These  personalities  are  probably  the  best  adapted  to  the  current  world,  where  everything  is  fast  and  changes  quickly.  Indeed,  they  have  Pitta’s  adaptability  and  Kapha’s  stability.  On top of that, they generally have excellent health, due to their high metabolism induced by Pitta and their strong Kapha constitution. Likewise, with regards to their personality, Kapha's caution and natural calm soften Pitta's fire and anger.These  individuals  generally  prefer  temperate  climates,  but  easily  withstand  extreme  heat  or  cold.  They  get  a  lot  of  benefit  from  intense  exercise,  including  sexual  activity.  Their  imbalance  is  expressed by the oily and humid characteristics that the two doshas share. That said, their natural ability to evolve and succeed in the world tends to reinforce Pitta's self-confidence and arrogance, as well as Kapha's pride and self-satisfaction.This  often  makes  them  impervious  to  criticism,  but  very  sensitive  to  flattery.  In  short,  Pitta-Kapha people  that  are  successful  can  be  tough  to  deal  with  in  everyday  life.  They  are  short  of  Vata,  and  Pitta-Kaphas  need  Vata’s  introspection  as  well  as  to  put  themselves  in  unpredictable  situations  to  tame their tendency toward arrogance and pride.

**Vata-Kapha** – The  characteristic  these  two  doshas  have  in  common  is  cold.  However,  they  don’t  suffer from it as much as pure Vatas, thanks to Kaphas strong constitution. They, therefore, have a double emotional need for heat, and this lack tends to cause them digestive disturbances, including constipation, as well as respiratory diseases, with high levels of mucus.Physically,  they  tend  to  be  tall  and  to  have  traits  expressing  the  perfect  mix  of  these  two  doshas.  They  are  very  involved  and  enthusiastic  in  each  of  their  activities.  They  are  by  turns  light,  passionate, dynamic and open like Vata, but also deep, secretive, and mysterious like Kapha. The   absence   of   Pitta   makes   it   difficult   for   them   to   have   consistent,   reliable,   upstanding   personalities. They tend to follow the advice of the most influential person and to have unfounded certainties.  Their  hypersensitivity  resulting  from  their  two  doshas  sometimes  leaves  them  with  deep emotional wounds. They have trouble protecting themselves.

**Doshic Constitution Test**

You  will  now  take  the  doshic  constitution  test.  Ask  yourself  the  question,  “are  you  rather  ____,  _____, or ____?”. Respond first based on how you feel right now or recently.Check the box that corresponds with your answer: V, P, or K. At the end of the test, count up your points and determine your current constitution, and whether it is dual, triple, or single.

To  have  an  overall  perspective,  it  is  advised  that  you  establish  the  percentage  for  each  result  obtained. For example: V:15, P:13, K:415/32 x 100 = 46.8,

- which we round to 47%13/32 x 100 = 40.6,
- which we round to 41%4/32 x 100 = 12.5,
- which we round at 12%

We  are  therefore  looking  at  a  personality  of  Vata-Pitta  constitution,  dominated  by  Vata.  You  have  just established your Vikruti, meaning your current constitution, which can be different from your original constitution.To  establish  your  Prakriti  (or  original  constitution,  which  you  must  find  or  maintain  to  be  in  balance),  repeat  the  test  a  second  time,  and  respond  by  indicating  how  you  perceive  yourself  in  general  since  you  were  a  young  child.  This  will  tell  you  the  state  of  stability  that  you  should strive toward.
